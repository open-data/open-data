Open Government Metadata - Government of Canada

Information and documentation for the Government of Canada's Open Government Metadata Initiative

The main objective of the Open Government Portal is to provide access to open resources, currently through the Open Data Portal and the Open Information Portal. In order to ensure effective search and discovery of these resources, the Open Government Secretariat, with the assistance of the Information Management Division within the Treasury Board Secretariat, has been focusing on improving the quality of metadata used to describe them.
