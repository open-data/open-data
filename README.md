Information and documentation for the Government of Canada's Open Data Initiative

Below is information about the ‘OG Common Core MES’ file.

The main objective of the Open Government Portal is to provide access to open resources, currently through the Open Data Portal and the Open Information Portal. In order to ensure effective search and discovery of these resources, the Open Government Secretariat, with the assistance of the Information Management Division within the Treasury Board Secretariat,  has been focusing on improving the quality of metadata used to describe them. The objective of developing the ‘Open Government Common Core Metadata Element Set’ is to establish a set of core elements that can be used to consistently describe all resources found on the open government portal, regardless of which catalogue it belongs to, or source of origin.

By applying these common core elements to all resources, we will ultimately be able to develop a single search for all open government resources, rather than the separate catalogues currently found on the site. Since the collections will continue to grow over time, for example the addition of the open maps collection, and potentially the open science collection, we would like to develop and implement the core set as soon as possible. We will also align this core closely with the element set that will be implemented by the Web Renewal Initiative group in order to ensure interoperability. Finally, in additional to this set of common elements, we will be able to support domain specific metadata extensions to further describe resources found in a given ‘catalogue’, i.e. open data, open information, open maps etc.

We would like to take this opportunity to consult with the metadata and open data community to gather feedback on what this ‘Open Government Common Core Metadata Element Set’ should include. A draft element set has been developed, and you can access it below. Please take the time to review this draft, and propose any alterations, additions or suggestions by Friday June 26th, 2015. We will then finalize the element set, and begin implementing it in CKAN, our metadata catalogue.

Please send all feedback to Alannah.Hilt@tbs-sct.gc.ca.

Thank you very much for your time, and assistance with this initiative.
