Open Government Metadata - Government of Canada

Information and documentation for the Government of Canada's Open Government Metadata Initiative

The main objective of the Open Government Portal is to provide access to open resources, currently through the Open Data Portal and the Open Information Portal. In order to ensure effective search and discovery of these resources, the Open Government Secretariat, with the assistance of the Information Management Division within the Treasury Board Secretariat, has been focusing on improving the quality of metadata used to describe them. 

Here you will find some documentation our group has been working on. This includes:

* DRAFT - Open Government Common Core Metadata Element Set -  a set of draft core elements that can be used to consistently describe all resources found on the open government portal, regardless of which catalogue it belongs to, or source of origin. This draft was sent for consultation both internal and external to the Government of Canada.
* FINAL- Open Government Common Core - a final set of common core metadata element sets to be used to describe both open data and open information
* Open Government Common Core MES - Summary - A summary document of the feedback received during the consultation, including action items for each comment
* Project Plan- Applying DCAT and Schema.org to open.canada.ca - a project plan to mark-up the Open Government Common Core Metadata Element Set using HTML data

The newest file, as of January 2016, is : 

* Draft Open Information Metadata Element Set 2.0 - a draft element set to be used to describe open information resources; including but not limited to, documents, videos, photos and other unstructured digital information. This document is now open for consultation, until Wednesday February 3rd 2016. Feedback will be gathered, and updates and revisions will be made in order to develop the final version. A final version, and summary report will then be shared here.
