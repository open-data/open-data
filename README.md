Information and documentation for the Government of Canada’s Open Government Metadata Initiative

The main objective of the Open Government Portal is to provide access to open resources, currently through the Open Data Portal and the Open Information Portal. In order to ensure effective search and discovery of these resources, the Open Government Secretariat, with the assistance of the Information Management Division within the Treasury Board Secretariat, has been focusing on improving the quality of metadata used to describe them. The objective of developing the ‘Open Government Common Core Metadata Element Set’ is to establish a set of core elements that can be used to consistently describe all resources found on the open government portal, regardless of which catalogue it belongs to, or source of origin. By applying these common core elements to all resources, we will ultimately be able to develop a single search for all open government resources, rather than the separate catalogues currently found on the site.

Here you will find the draft scheme, the final version, a consultation summary report, and a draft project plan for applying DCAT and Schema.org to the Government of Canada’s ‘Open Government Common Core Metadata Element Set’.
